    <string name="desc">Feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighbourhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best \n\nEveryday can be a better day despite the challenge
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
Its gonna get difficult to stand but hold your balance
I just say whatever cause there is no way around it cause \n\nEveryone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know itll all be fine
Its ok, uhhuh, uh
Its okay, its okay \n\nFeeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighbourhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best \n\nSomedays you wake up and nothing works you feel surrounded
Gotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded
Keep good things inside your ears justâ€¦</string>
